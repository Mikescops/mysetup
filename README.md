### Notes to developers

* Warning: the `pages` tables present in the SQL DB **IS NOT** a CakePHP entity. It's just a container for more or less "static" HTML content.

* Will be 'administrator' the users having a `verified` value equal to `125`, and the account with an email address as `admin@admin.admin` (which cannot be verified...).

* During development, you may get an error into the console: `TypeError: a.result is undefined`. Don't bother, this is due to the JS social module.

* During development, you won't be able to add a comment to a setup (Google's invisible CAPTCHA checks the domain name environment).
