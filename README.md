### Notes to developers

* Will be 'administrators' users having a `verified` value equal to `125`, AND the account with an email address and password as (`admin@admin.admin` / `adminadmin`) (which cannot be verified...).

* On the first connection as `admin`, your profile picture will be broken. Please fix this by uploading one.

* During development, you may get an error into the console: `TypeError: a.result is undefined`. Don't bother, this is due to the JS social module.

* The plugin _loadsys/cakephp\_sitemap_ has been re-coded by [**@Mikescops**](https://github.com/Mikescops). **:warning: It won't be updated anymore because we blocked _Composer_ from tracking it :warning:**.

* If you wanna add a translation for a foreign language, just add _default.po_ / _default.mo_ and _core.po_ / _core.mo_ files into `src/Locale/xx_XX/`, and authorize this new locale in `src/Application.php`. In order to extract the strings from the source code, and edit them with _Poedit_, just follow this scenario :
