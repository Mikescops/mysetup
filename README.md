### Notes to developers

* Warning: the `pages` tables present in the SQL DB **IS NOT** a CakePHP entity. It's just a container for more or less "static" HTML content.

* Will be 'administrator' the users having a `verified` value equal to `125`, and the account with an email address and password as (`admin@admin.admin` / `adminadmin`) (which cannot be verified...).

* During development, you may get an error into the console: `TypeError: a.result is undefined`. Don't bother, this is due to the JS social module.

* The plugin _loadsys/cakephp\_sitemap_ has been re-coded by @Mike Scops. **/!\ If you clone and install this repository, please take care of having the correct sources. /!\\**

* If you wanna add a translation for a foreign language, just add _default.po_ / _default.mo_ files into `src/Locale/xx_XX/`, and authorize this new locale in `src/Application.php`.
